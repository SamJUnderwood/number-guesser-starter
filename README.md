# Number Guesser Game

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Number Guesser Game! This project is a simple and interactive web-based game where players try to guess a randomly generated number. The game is designed to demonstrate my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it incorporates key concepts of user interaction, logic, and game development.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo <a href="https://SamJUnderwood.github.io/number-guesser-starter/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number between 0 and 9 for each round.
- **User and Computer Guess**: Both the user and the computer make guesses, and the game determines who is closer to the target number.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the scores for both the user and the computer.
- **Round Advancement**: The game advances to the next round after each guess and updates the round number.
- **Accessibility**: The game is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring it is usable by a wide range of players.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core logic and functionality of the game.
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and presentation of the game.

- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.
- `game.js`: Additional JavaScript file that interacts with `script.js` to handle user interactions.
